# Zombies #

Probably do a [https://code.google.com/p/legend-of-darwin/issues/detail?id=](https://code.google.com/p/legend-of-darwin/issues/detail?id=) for a zombie AI path planning

Zombies from the brainstorm:
  * red zombie
  * fast zombie
  * smart zombie
  * blind zombie
  * conga zombie/worm zombie line
  * lone-star zombies vs pack zombies
  * cannibal zombies  "cannibal with regular zombies". he doesn't care for humans, only zombies
  * slime zombie with trail
  * teleporting zombie
  * king zombie, all the zombie love him (elvis?)  final boss?
  * ghost zombie
  * baby zombie 
  * mommy zombie
  * mommy zombie with babies following, like baby ducks. darwin can walk over babies to squish, but that enrages mommy zombie
  * raptor zombie
  * robot zombie
  * scared zombies
  * liger/tigon zombies
  * sleeping track star zombie...don't walk on the dry leaves (or whatever "flag" to wake him up)  "sneaking level"
  * pirate zombie
  * ninja zombie
  * mickey mouse zombie
  * zombie that ride stuff
  * zombies that jump
  * zombies with balloons
  * zombies that throw little zombies
  * armoured zombies
  * exploding zombies  (in boss level)
  * giant zombie - 4 squares, final boss "lure in exploding zombies for him to eat"
  * basic zombie - can optimize him a bit
  * two zombie gangs that dont like each other
